A blockchain is “a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, 
called blocks.” These blocks “are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of 
the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

“Each block contains a hash (a digital fingerprint or unique identifier), 
timestamped batches of recent valid transactions, and the hash of the previous block

users, nodes or participants in the blockchain network will be connected through socket network.

each node will have a copy of the database, means the transactions data is kept transparent and public in the network.

PoW and PoS mechanisms will be implemented for consensus.

smart contract mechanism will be implemented.
