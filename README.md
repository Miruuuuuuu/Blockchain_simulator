A blockchain transaction is a transfer of value or information from one person to another that is recorded on a blockchain. To understand this, let’s break it down into the simplest steps possible.

Step-by-Step Explanation
Step 1: Understanding Blockchain
Blockchain: Think of it as a digital ledger or record book that is distributed across many computers. It keeps track of all transactions made in a secure and transparent way.
Block: A collection of transactions grouped together.
Chain: Blocks are linked together in a sequence, forming a chain.
Step 2: Basic Terminologies
Wallet: A digital tool that allows users to store and manage their cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum). It has two main components:
Public Key: Like an email address; it's shared with others so they can send you cryptocurrency.
Private Key: Like a password; it's kept secret and used to authorize transactions.
Transaction: The act of sending cryptocurrency from one wallet to another.
Node: A computer that participates in the blockchain network, keeping a copy of the blockchain and helping to verify transactions.
Miner: A special type of node that groups transactions into blocks and adds them to the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their work.
Simulating a Blockchain Transaction
Let’s go through a simple example of Alice sending some cryptocurrency to Bob.

Step 1: Alice Decides to Send Cryptocurrency to Bob
Alice has some cryptocurrency in her digital wallet and wants to send some to Bob.

Step 2: Creating the Transaction
Alice’s Wallet: Alice opens her digital wallet and enters Bob’s public key (like his email address for receiving cryptocurrency).
Amount: Alice specifies how much cryptocurrency she wants to send to Bob.
Signing: Alice’s wallet uses her private key (password) to sign the transaction. This proves that Alice is indeed the one sending the cryptocurrency and not someone else.
Step 3: Broadcasting the Transaction
Broadcast: Alice’s wallet sends (broadcasts) the signed transaction to the blockchain network.
Propagation: The transaction is shared among all the nodes in the network. Each node gets a copy of the transaction.
Step 4: Verifying the Transaction
Validation: Nodes in the network check if the transaction is valid. They ensure that Alice has enough cryptocurrency to send and that the transaction is properly signed with her private key.
Mempool: Valid transactions are temporarily stored in a pool called the mempool, waiting to be included in a block.
Step 5: Mining the Transaction
Miners Collect Transactions: Miners pick transactions from the mempool and group them into a block.
Solving a Puzzle: Miners compete to solve a complex mathematical puzzle. The first miner to solve it gets to add their block of transactions to the blockchain.
Block Addition: Once a miner solves the puzzle, the new block (containing Alice’s transaction) is added to the blockchain.
Reward: The miner who added the block gets a reward in the form of cryptocurrency.
Step 6: Finalizing the Transaction
Confirmation: The new block is shared with all nodes in the network. Nodes update their copies of the blockchain to include the new block.
Transaction Complete: Bob’s wallet sees the new block on the blockchain and updates his balance. The cryptocurrency sent by Alice is now available to Bob.
Summary
Alice wants to send cryptocurrency to Bob.
Alice creates and signs a transaction with her private key.
The transaction is broadcast to the blockchain network.
Nodes verify the transaction and add it to the mempool.
Miners pick transactions from the mempool, group them into blocks, and add them to the blockchain by solving puzzles.
The new block is confirmed and added to the blockchain.
Bob receives the cryptocurrency.
This process ensures that the transaction is secure, transparent, and cannot be altered once it’s added to the blockchain.




A blockchain is “a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, 
called blocks.” These blocks “are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of 
the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

“Each block contains a hash (a digital fingerprint or unique identifier),
a block is a group of transactions grouped togather. 
timestamped batches of recent valid transactions, and the hash of the previous block

users, nodes or participants in the blockchain network will be connected through socket network.

each node will have a copy of the database, means the transactions data is kept transparent and public in the network.

PoW and PoS mechanisms will be implemented for consensus.

smart contract mechanism will be implemented.
